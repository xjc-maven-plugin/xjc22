# JAXB2 Maven Plugin #

Welcome to the `org.hisrc.xjc:xjc22-maven-plugin`, the most advanced and feature-full Maven plugin for XML Schema compilation.

This Maven plugin wraps and enhances the [JAXB](https://jaxb.java.net/) [Schema Compiler (XJC)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/xjc.html) and allows
compiling XML Schemas (as well as WSDL, DTDs, RELAX NG) into Java classes in Maven builds.

> If you are interested in the Mojohaus JAXB2 Maven Plugin (`org.codehaus.mojo:jaxb2-maven-plugin`),
> please follow [this link](https://github.com/mojohaus/jaxb2-maven-plugin) to the corresponding website.

## Quick start ##

* Put your schemas (`*.xsd`) and bindings (`*.xjb`) into the `src/main/resources` folder.
* Add the plugin to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<project ...>
	...
	<build>
		<plugins>
			...
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.hisrc.xjc</groupId>
				<artifactId>xjc22-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>0.14.0</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<goals>
							<goal>generate</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
			...
		</plugins>
	</build>
	...
</project>
```
